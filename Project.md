## ASR: Testing

AUCA Simple Renderer (ASR) is a graphics engine being developed on the course
Computer Graphics (COM-391) at AUCA to study topics of real-time computer
graphics.

The task of the course project is to develop many test applications to
demonstrate the correctness of the engine's implementation.

### Task 1 (Engine Version 1.0)

Ensure that your development environment is set correctly, and you can compile,
run, and debug the following version of the engine

* <https://github.com/toksaitov/asr-project/tree/12d1c1e91ebac9dc81436626969552e94050b199>

Note that you need to point to a specific commit to get Version 1.0 of the
graphics engine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toksaitov/asr-project.git
git checkout 12d1c1e91ebac9dc81436626969552e94050b199
```
