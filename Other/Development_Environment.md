Development Environment
=======================

Prepare the development environment at home.

* Install the latest drivers for your GPU.
* Install Git VCS <https://git-scm.com>.
* Install Conan Package Manager <https://conan.io>.
* Install CMake Build System <https://cmake.org>.
* On macOS, install Xcode IDE <https://developer.apple.com/xcode>.
* On Windows, install Visual Studio 2022 Community IDE <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs> or any other edition if you can acquire it legally.

You can use any other IDEs (like CLion) or code editors (like VS Code, Vim, Emacs) that you like. However, please note that we can only provide support for Visual Studio 2022 on Windows and Xcode on macOS.

You can also work on Linux, but you must figure out the driver/tools/editor-installation process.
