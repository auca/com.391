Homework
========

## Week 1

1. Prepare the development environment at home.

    * Install the latest drivers for your GPU.
    * Install git <https://git-scm.com>.
    * Install Python 3 <https://www.python.org>.
    * Install CMake <https://cmake.org>.
    * On macOS install Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode>.
    * On Windows install Visual Studio 2019 Community <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs>
      or any other edition if you can acquire it legally.

You can use any other IDEs (like CLion) or code editors (like VS Code, Vim,
Emacs) that you like. Please do note that we can only provide support for Visual
Studio 2019 on Windows and Xcode on macOS.

You can also work on Linux, but you have to figure out the
driver/tools/editor-installation process on your own.
