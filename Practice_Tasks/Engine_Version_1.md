Practice Tasks for Engine Version 1.0
=====================================

## ASR: Testing

AUCA Simple Renderer (ASR) is a graphics engine being developed in the course Computer Graphics (COM-391) at AUCA to study topics of real-time computer graphics.

In this set of practice tasks, students must develop various test applications to demonstrate the correctness of the **procedural** engine's implementation.

### Task 1 (Engine Version 1.0)

Ensure that your development environment is set correctly, and you can compile, run, and debug the following version of the engine

* <https://github.com/toksaitov/asr-project/tree/6c7db14f1a2bab226e3aa7057d4974d1d9ed1422>

Note that you must point Git to a specific commit to get Version 1.0 of the graphics engine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toksaitov/asr-project.git
git checkout 6c7db14f1a2bab226e3aa7057d4974d1d9ed1422
```
